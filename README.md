Iris Classification using Decision Tree

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into species using a Decision Tree Classifier.

Project Description

The model is trained on the Iris dataset, which contains flower measurements. Based on these measurements, the model predicts the species of the flower.
